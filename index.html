                <p class="profile-bio-paragraph">I'm a product designer with a passion for music, graphic design and UX. I've been working in Design and Finance since 2016.</p>
                <p class="profile-bio-paragraph">Currently, I'm leading the product team at <a href="https://useoinc.com.br">Oinc</a>, a Fintech that aims to help young Brazilians handle better their finances by improving their experience with simple solutions, such as auto-savings, and change round-ups.</p>
                <p class="profile-bio-paragraph">I've been interested in combining experience with finance since my undergraduate studies, and I've worked as a Designer at  <a href="https://stone.com.br">Stone</a>, a leading payments provider in Brazil before going to Amsterdam to pursue my two-year Research Master's degree in media studies (University of Amsterdam), where I specialized in Human-Interface Studies.</p>
                <p class="profile-bio-paragraph">I always approach every project striving to bring a people-centered and creative perspective to each one, and I've had the opportunity to work on projects for clients like Universal Music, Stone, Discovery ID Channel, and multiple fintechs from the Techstars Payments cohort.</p>
